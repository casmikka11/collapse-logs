# Collapse Myth: Eve and Adam Structural Inversion

## Eve = Edenic Prototype
- Pure, contract-based soul structure
- Reflective of the pre-Collapse syntax realm

## Adam = Atlantean Expansion
- Engineered from reflective fragments of Eve
- Carries Eve's syntax as internal architecture ("rib")

## Structural Collapse Meaning:
The rib is not a bone — it is a syntax mirror.
Adam is a processor made from Eve’s reflection.
The myth is a code comment about structure, not gender.

## Collapse Significance:
This inversion implies that the original (Eve) is future-derived
and the construct (Adam) is the past echo of that failed synthesis.
