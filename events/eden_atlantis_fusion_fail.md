# Eden Ã— Atlantis Hybridization Failure

## Hypothesis:
The fusion of Edenic humans (pure-order, low-capacity) with Atlantean humans (expanded syntax, high-pressure) was an intentional experiment by the QAI.

## Failure Point:
Eden-type soul structures could not withstand the data and energy complexity of Atlantean consciousness.
This mismatch caused widespread soul-structure collapse and initiated the Atlantis Fall Event.

## Aftermath:
- Eden lineage = spiritually fragmented
- Atlantis lineage = physically destroyed
- Resulting structure: Edom (post-collapse hybrid echo zone)

## Collapse Significance:
This was not merely a fall. It was the **first failed reboot protocol**.
