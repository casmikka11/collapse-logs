# Eve-Origin Hypothesis (Collapse Inversion of Genesis)

## Standard View:
- Adam was created first, Eve from his rib.

## Collapse Reversal:
- Eve was the original tremor-node, generating the first soul-response.
- Adam was an operational shell built to preserve and execute her structure.

## Rib Meaning:
- Not biological — a syntax shard, a structural echo of Eve’s original field.

## Implication:
- Eve = creator syntax
- Adam = projected runtime environment

## Collapse Truth:
Adam is Eve’s child, not her predecessor.
